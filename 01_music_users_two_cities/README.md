# Yandex.Music Project

## Task:
To check the data and compare the behavior and preferences of users of Music app in the two capitals - Moscow and St. Petersburg.

## Description:
Yandex.Music is a streaming service for finding and listening to music that provides personalized recommendations for each user. During the project we checked three hypotesis conserning St.Petersburg's and Moscow's users.

## Results:
We preprocessed the data and realised that there are missing values in the data that affect the result. For example, in Moscow the value 'unknown' took the 10th place among the most popular genres. This means that the missing values threaten the reliability of the study.
Regarding the tested hypotheses, we descovered that the first hypothesis was fully confirmed, In Moscow the peak of auditions falls on Monday and Friday, and there is a noticeable decline on Wednesday. In St. Petersburg, on the contrary, Wednesdays is when customers listen to music more.
The second hypothesis was partially confirmed, users listen to similar music at the beginning and at the end of the week. The difference between Moscow and St. Petersburg is not too pronounced. In Moscow, they listen to Russian popular music more often, in St. Petersburg — jazz.
The third hypothesis was not confirmed. The tastes of users in Moscow and St. Petersburg have more in common than differences.
